## Description
What Not To Do At A Stoplight is an educational application to make driving safer.

The app features a blog section where guests can read comments related to safe driving at intersections. The blog is viewable to all guests without signing in.  Upon signing in, guests become users with the ability to create, edit or delete their posts.  Everyone has  the option to enter the quiz portion of the app. The quiz presents an illustrated traffic scenario, question and multiple choice answers.  Users have a set time limit to answer each question, and the scoring system is based on how many questions they answer correctly within the allotted time.  Upon entering an answer the app will pause the timer and show the correct answer.  Questions are based on the WA State Department of Transportation Drivers Handbook 2023.
